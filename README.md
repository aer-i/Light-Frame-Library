⚠️Unfinished⚠️

Don't use that, it's terrible.

Simple C++ 20 libary for window creation, input handling, 2d rendering via Vulkan 1.3.

Working only on Visual Studio for now.
Maybe I will add CMake support in future.🧢

features:
- rendering quads :)
- 2d camera

TODO:
- add index buffer
- add textures
- add text rendering
- add frustum culling
- improve camera
- add input handling
- add ImGui support
- add multithreaded command buffers generation
- overload vectors
