Don't use that, it's terrible.

Simple C++ 20 library for window creation, input handling, 2d rendering via Vulkan 1.3.

Working only on Visual Studio for now.
Maybe I will add CMake support in future.üß¢

features:
- rendering quads (even with textures) :)
- rendering text
- 2d camera
- quad frustum culling
- keyboard & mouse input handling

TODO:
- FIX DESCRIPTOR INDEXING
- improve camera
- add ImGui support
- add multithreaded command buffers generation (maybe)
- everything to be honest
