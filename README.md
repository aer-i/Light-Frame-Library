⚠️Unfinished⚠️

Don't use that, it's terrible.

Simple C++ 20 libary for window creation, input handling, 2d rendering via Vulkan 1.3.

Working only on Visual Studio for now.
Maybe I will add CMake support in future.🧢

features:
- rendering quads :)
- 2d camera
- quad frustum culling
- keyboard & mouse input handling

TODO:
- add textures
- add text rendering
- improve camera
- add ImGui support
- add multithreaded command buffers generation
- overload vectors
- everything to be honest
